# Virtual_Board

In recent years, there has been a need to ensure continuity of student learning in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The board is the central tool, physically in the classroom and pedagogically. Its functions are multiple because it not only allows for writing but also to draw, to put up magnets or to project, it helps 
Students  better understand and memorize the course. The use of colors and shapes is not to be neglected to gain understanding. 
Drawings or diagrams are often very appreciated and greatly facilitate understanding, especially for more complex concepts. In fact, teachers find it difficult to explain by drawing with their mouse during their presentation.
In this article, we will build a virtual board as an extension in video lectures that can draw anything by simply capturing the movement of a colored marker with a camera. 
Here, the first finger is used as a marker. We are going to use the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to realize this project. 
The preferred language is Python because of its exhaustive libraries and easy-to-use syntax, but by understanding the basics, it can be implemented in any language supported by OpenCV.
